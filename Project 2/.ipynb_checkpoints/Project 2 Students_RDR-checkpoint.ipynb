    "### Interpretation: Diabetes by region \n",
    "\n",
    "In the histograms shown above the horizontal axis shows the percentage of individuals per county with diabetes, while the vertical axis is the count of counties. Based on these graphs it appears that in the midwest, south and southeast there are higher proportions of diabetes cases experienced in counties in these regions. However, though there appears to be a larger number of southern counties compared to other regions, this does not necessarily mean that it is a more populous region. Given this, I might advise focusing programmatic efforts in these areas over the west, and northeast. "

    "### Interpretation: Diabetes and obsesity\n",
    "Given the scatter plot above that looks at the relationship between diabetes and obesity, there is a clear positive association, which means that as the cases of obesity increase by county, so do cases of diabetes. \n",
    "\n",
    "In the histograms that look at obesity by region, the horizontal axis shows the percentage of individuals per county with obesity, while the vertical axis is the count of counties. Each region appears to have a relatively normal distribution, though they show different levels of obesity. For example, in the south, it looks like approximately 95% of the counties in this region, at least 20% of people in each county have obesity and it looks like the mean proportion of people with obesity in each county is around 30%. Similarly, in the midwest, 95% of the counties have 20-30% of their residents experiencing obesity, with a mean of around 25%.

    "The histograms above show that In the southeast, south, and midwest for every county that scores above the mean for the region, the counts decrease rapidly (less and less density much faster compared to building up to the mean), which makes a shark fin shape, especially in the south. As your physical inactivity proportion increases, there are fewer counties with high inactivity numbers. \n",
    "\n",
    "In comparing these histograms with those above that show obesity by region, it is clear that many people who are not active are not necessarily obese. Further, when considering all three sets of histograms, despite the relationship between diabetes and obesity and diabetes and physical inactivity, it’s clear that not everyone who is obese and/or inactive has diabetes. However, it still may be beneficial to focus programmatic efforts on reducing obesity by increasing physical activity in the regions with highest concentrations of diabetes. "

    "1. Linear Regression: Given the strong linear relationship between Diabetes and Obesity/Physical Inactivity, linear regression may be an appropriate model to use. Linear regression assumes that there is a linear relationship between the variables and predictions. While it is a simple model that’s pretty easy to understand, it is also very sensitive to outliers and susceptible to overfitting. \n",
    "\n",
    "2. LASSO: It might be helpful to use LASSO, given the many coefficients, so that they can be automatically selected. LASSO also assumes linearity, homoscedasticity, independence, and normality. There are several pros to LASSO, including that it prevents overfitting via regularization, is helpful for feature selection, and it manages multicollinearity. However, the fact that LASSO auto-selects features is also a challenge, it is extremely sensitive to outliers and scaling. \n",
    "\n",
    "3. Ridge: Given the strong linear relationship between Diabetes and Obesity/Physical Inactivity, ridge regression may be appropriate. Additionally, because it avoids overfitting by penalizing the use of too many coefficients, it also might be particularly appropriate for this context. While ridge reduces overfitting, manages multicollinearity, and does not have feature selection, it also may introduce bias in the coefficient estimates and also is more complicated to run, given that it requires more hyperparameter tuning than other models.

    "Overfitting is when a model becomes too sensitive or flexible to the training data. In this case the model may be excellent at making predictions based on that specific dataset, however, as a result, it is not good at making predictions based on the validation set or in general, which is the point of machine learning. Overfitting happens when the test error is much worse than the training error because the model is too responsive to outliers from the training set. The best way to address overfitting is by using models like LASSO and ridge, which have regularizers. "

    "In order to conduct this analysis, we cleaned the data and then divided it into 3 sets: 60%for  training, 20% for validation, and 20% for testing. Then we trained the models using the training data in order to look at three models, including linear regression, LASSO and ridge. Next, using the validation data we made predictions and compared the prediction vs actual points in a scatter plot and calculated MSEs for each. At this point we were able to see that ridge was the best model, then retrained and tested it. \n",

Similarly, if I had included race in the analysis, I suspect that the results would change. I definitely would not feel confident deploying this type of analysis or model in the real world because I feel like I am still trying to understand exactly how it works. "
